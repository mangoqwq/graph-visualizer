~~multiple tabs~~
modify (add cycles, paths, Kn, Kn,m, flower, take compliment, make directed/undirected)
arrange (freeze/unfreeze all planar embed, polygonal embed, dfs tree, bfs tree, etc.)
locate (bridges, cut vertices, centroid)
markup (draw bubbles, set edge/vertex highlight style, show ids)
export (as svg, png, markup, tikz)

possible import from adj matrix/adj list?
possible algorithm? (shortest path, flow, matching, centroid tree), can throw errors and handle with react hehe
possible experimental? (adjusting gravity, etc. )

~~input format~~

id:
id: label
id id ...

~~difficult stuff~~
multi-edges/curved edges
highlight hovered edge/vertex
dark mode

~~todo~~
different components shouldn't push each other too far, fix with gravity, or threshold for electric repulsion
text-editor should properly reflect the inital graph (lone vertices, labeled vertices)
